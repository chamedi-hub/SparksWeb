							We as <strong>Layer 7 Innovations</strong> believe that responsible and sustainable change for the people through technology in contributing to Sustainable Development Goal 9; Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation.
							<br><br>
							The 2030 Agenda is a plan of action for people, planet and prosperity. It also seeks to strengthen universal peace in larger freedom. We recognise that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development.
							<br><br>
							All countries and all stakeholders, acting in collaborative partnership, will implement this plan. We are resolved to free the human race from the tyranny of poverty and want and to heal and secure our planet. It is determined to take the bold and transformative steps which are urgently needed to shift the world onto a sustainable and resilient path. As we embark on this collective journey, we pledge that no one will be left behind. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals and 169 targets which we are announcing today demonstrate the scale and ambition of this new universal Agenda. They seek to build on the Millennium Development Goals and complete what these did not achieve. They seek to realize the human rights of all and to achieve gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls. They are integrated and indivisible and balance the three dimensions of sustainable development: the economic, social and environmental.

						<h2 class="display-4">SDGs in <span>ICT.</span></h2>
						<p>In recent decades, ICT has delivered significant economical and social progress. But, more needs to be done, as its benefits are unevenly distributed and can’t always be fully enforced, to foster sustainable development and drive it forward.</p>

									<strong>ICT is highly correlated with country-level SDG performance (89%), which suggests that countries that perform well on ICT perform equally as well on SDGs. </strong>
									And, those that underperform on ICT are also lagging behind on SDG achievement. While this doesn’t prove causality,it certainly suggests a strong relationship between the two.
								</span>
							</li>
							<li>
								<ion-icon name="done-all" role="img" class="hydrated" aria-label="done all"></ion-icon>
								<span>
									<strong>Progress on certain SDGs is more likely to be correlated with ICT development. </strong>
									Goals with higher ICT correlation include, SDG 9: Infrastructure, Industrialisation and Innovation, SDG 4: Quality Education and SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being, which suggests that these may be the areas with the greatest potential for leveraging ICT for sustainable development.
								</span>
							</li>
							<li>
								<ion-icon name="done-all" role="img" class="hydrated" aria-label="done all"></ion-icon>
								<span>
									<strong>Overall, developed countries tend to have higher ICT scores than SDG scores, indicating that ICT development is progressing more quickly than sustainable development. </strong>
									These countries ultimately have the scope the leverage ICT more effectively, for the benefit of sustainability. And, inversely, developing countries generally have a higher SDG achievement score than ICT development score, suggesting that the speed of ICT enhancements isn’t keeping pace with the progress on sustainable development. Developing nations may well benefit from policies that aim to increase investment in ICT and in turn improve the ICT infrastructure.
								</span>
							</li>
							<li>
								<ion-icon name="done-all" role="img" class="hydrated" aria-label="done all"></ion-icon>
								<span>
									<strong>Although Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita is a factor that influences the Benchmark scores, there are several elements that make this correlation more complex. </strong>
									The ICT Sustainable Development Goals Benchmark has a greater association with both the Human Development Index (HDI) and the Environmental Performance Index (EPI) compared to GDP per capita. This suggests that the key, influencing factor isn’t the amount of resources available, but in fact, how these resources are implemented.
